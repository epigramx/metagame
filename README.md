# Fork's notes:
1) Initially based on the presentation at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miu3ldl-nY4
2) See the _process text file for details on how to install and run
3) Mainly you copy paste data from d0nkey's "As Class" X 11

# metagame
Compute metagame bounds from matchup charts.

No command-line interface as of yet - easiest thing is to just copy paste! There's very little code. You WILL however need to install pandas, matplotlib, pulp, and seaborn to use the code.
